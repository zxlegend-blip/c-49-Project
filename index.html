Origami is an ancient art form that is believed to have been around
<br>
for nearly 2000 years, derived from the Japanese tradition of paper-folding.
<br>
Though they were not the first to experiment with the culture of paper-folding,
<br>
they were the first to use this technique as a style of art. As you can imagine, 
<br>
itâ€™s had quite a lucrative history and is deeply embedded in Japanese culture.
